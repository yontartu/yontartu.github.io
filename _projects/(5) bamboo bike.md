# How to Build a Bamboo Bike from Scratch

Before moving to Beijing in 2017, I'd heard about a bicycle studio that put on workshops to teach people how to build a bike out of bamboo and carbon fiber. While I was in college I'd welded my own bike out of steel, an experience which I had absolutely loved. But bamboo! This I couldn't pass up. I signed up for a workshop soon after settling into my dorm at Peking University.

Bamboo Bicycles Beijing (BBB) is nestled in the old quarter of Beijing within the Second Ring Road, just Northeast of the Forbidden City on a quiet alleyway called *Langjia hutong*. In these ancient mazes of narrow streets, the incessant buzz of the bustling city recedes into a calm. Retirees taking leisurely strolls wander by, the curious ones occassionally peering into the studio.

The workshop is a cramped 500 square feet or so, but they've somehow managed to fit six workstations into the space. On the frigid December weekend I show up, I'm the only one working on a bike.

### Day 1

The folks at BBB have refined their bike-building process to the point where you can finish putting together a bamboo frame over the course of a single weekend. Mowgli, my instructor, explained that they've settled on the current technique after years of experimentation. One wall of the workshop is covered with pictures of former students showing off their finished bikes, a testament to this history.

The first order of business was to pick out the pieces of bamboo for my bike. BBB sources its bamboo of Taiwan, after trying a variety of species and strands. I had been curious which varieties of bamboo I could use in my bike, but Mowgli said that they'd found green bamboo to be the most sturdy (they had previously used black bamboo extensively but had discovered some structural issues with some of their bikes). It was fun to examine each of the long bamboo pieces for idiosyncracies and quirks. I felt a bit like a panda picking out lunch.

After picking out three thicker pieces (for the top tube, down tube and seat tube) and two narrower ones for the seat stays and chain stays, I proceeded to cut one to its appropriate length and angle. Mowgli had pre-calculated the ideal dimensions, given my height, and used a software program to compute how to optimally slice each bamboo piece so that they'd fit together well.

<br>

Next we needed to mount each bamboo tube in a jig, which is used to hold each piece in place while the components can be bound together. (While the main structure of the bike was pure bamboo, steel components are used for the bottom bracket and head tube, which are necessary to install the crankset and headset into the bike.)

A few months after returning to the U.S., I reached out to Mowgli to say hello. He shared with me some sad news: BBB had recently closed its doors, unable to continue putting on bike-making workshops.
