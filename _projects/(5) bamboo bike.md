# How to Build a Bamboo Bike from Scratch

Before moving to Beijing in 2017, I'd heard about a bicycle studio that put on workshops to teach people how to build a bike out of bamboo and carbon fiber. While I was in college I'd welded my own bike out of steel, an experience which I had absolutely loved. But bamboo! This I couldn't pass up. I signed up for a workshop soon after settling into my dorm at Peking University.

Bamboo Bicycles Beijing (BBB) is nestled in the old quarter of Beijing within the Second Ring Road, just Northeast of the Forbidden City on a quiet alleyway called *Langjia hutong*. In these ancient mazes of narrow streets, the incessant buzz of the bustling city recedes into a calm. Retirees taking leisurely strolls wander by, the curious ones occassionally peering into the studio.

The workshop is a cramped 500 square feet or so, but they've somehow managed to fit six workstations into the space. On the frigid December weekend I show up, my friend Simon and I are the only ones there working on a bike.

### Day 1

The folks at BBB have refined their bike-building process to the point where you can finish putting together a bamboo frame over the course of a single weekend. Mowgli, my instructor, explained that they've settled on the current technique after years of experimentation. One wall of the workshop is covered with pictures of former students showing off their finished bikes, a testament to the shop's history and impact on the local community.

The first order of business was to pick out the pieces of bamboo to use in my bike. BBB sources its bamboo from Taiwan, after trying a variety of different species and strains. I had been curious which varieties of bamboo I could use in my bike, but Mowgli said that they'd found green bamboo to be the most sturdy (they had previously used black bamboo extensively but had discovered some structural issues with some of their bikes). It was fun to examine each of the long bamboo pieces for idiosyncracies and quirks. I felt a bit like a panda picking out lunch.

After picking out three thicker pieces (for the head tube, down tube and seat tube) and two narrower ones (for the seat stays and chain stays), I proceeded to cut each one to its appropriate length and angle. Mowgli had pre-calculated the ideal dimensions of each tubing, given my height, using a software program called CattleCAD to compute how to optimally slice each bamboo piece so that they'd fit together well for my dimensions.

Next, we needed to mount each bamboo tube in a jig, the wall-mounted device used to hold each tube in place while the components can be bound together. While the main structure of the bike was pure bamboo, steel components are used for the bottom bracket and head tube, which are necessary to install the crankset and headset into the bike, and carbon fiber bindings are used to join these steel pieces to the bamboo tubing.

BBB had recently invested in a laser engraver and offered to let me be the first to try it out on my bike! I though it would be neat to put "Bamboo Bicycles Beijing" on the down tube, and I also added the characters for my Chinese name on the inside of the seat tube.

After testing that each tubing fit well together within the jig, we then needed to remove each piece and prepare it for binding. The process involved roughly sanding down about a 3-inch strip at the end of each bamboo piece, a technique that would help the bind the glue-coated carbon fiber ribbons to the coarse bamboo. The center portions of the tube we carefully covered in plastic, to protect from any errant drips of glue.

After this preparation, we then reset the bamboo pieces into the jig and applied a small amount of glue to loosely lock together each bamboo-steel junction, using some extra electric tape to hold the top tube in position with the headset.

By the end of the afternoon on Saturday, I had a few tubes of bamboo glued to a few pieces of steel, but squint a bit it and it was starting to sort of look like a bike! Worn out from a long but exhilarating day, I stepped out of the shop, back into a darkening metropolis, winding my way back through the alleys, the cacophany of automobiles returning once I made it back to the main thoroughfare.

### Day 2

I returned to the studio early the next morning to survey our progress to date. While the previous day's work had mostly entailed preparation, Mowgli stated that today we were going to get pretty messy.

A few months after returning to the U.S., I reached out to Mowgli to say hello. He shared with me some sad news: BBB had recently closed its doors, unable to continue putting on bike-making workshops.
