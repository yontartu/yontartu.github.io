# How to Build a Bamboo Bike from Scratch

Before moving to Beijing in 2017, I'd heard about a bicycle studio that put on workshops to teach people how to build a bike out of bamboo and carbon fiber. While I was in college I'd welded my own bike out of steel, an experience which I had absolutely loved. But bamboo! This I couldn't pass up. I signed up for a workshop soon after settling into my dorm at Peking University.

Bamboo Bicycles Beijing (BBB) is nestled in the old quarter of Beijing within the Second Ring Road, just Northeast of the Forbidden City on a quiet alleyway called *Langjia hutong*. In these ancient mazes of narrow streets, the incessant buzz of the bustling city receded into a calm. Retirees taking leisurely strolls wander by, the curious ones occassionally peering into the studio.

The workshop is a cramped 500 square feet or so, but they've somehow managed to fit six workstations into the space. On the frigid December weekend I show up, I'm the only one working on a bike.

### Day 1

The folks at BBB have refined their bike-building process to the point where you can finish putting together a bamboo frame over the course of a single weekend. Mowgli, my instructure, explained that they're settled on the current technique after years of experimentation. One wall of the workshop is covered with pictures of former students showing off their finished bikes, a testament to this history.
