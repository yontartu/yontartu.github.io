# How to Build a Bamboo Bike from Scratch

Before moving to Beijing in 2017, I'd heard about a bicycle studio that put on workshops to teach people how to build a bike out of bamboo and carbon fiber. A few years I'd welded my own bike out of steel, an experience which I had absolutely loved. But bamboo! This I couldn't pass up. I signed up for a workshop soon  after settling into my dorm at Peking University.  

Bamboo Bicycles Beijing (BBB) is nestled in the old quarter of Beijing within the Second Ring Road, just Northeast of the Forbidden City on a quiet alleyway called *Langjia hutong*. In these ancient mazes of narrow streets, the incessant buzz of the bustling city receded into a calm.
