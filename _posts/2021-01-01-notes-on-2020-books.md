At the start of 2020, a goal that I set out for myself was to read one book every two weeks on average. One intense political campaign (and global pandemic) later, after a few intense months where I'd fallen woefully behind and some downtime after the election to make up for this lost ground, I just missed reaching my goal -- finishing with 25 books in all. In the past few years I'd mostly stuck to nonfiction, so this year I also experimented with reading a work of fiction, then nonfiction, in alternating fashion. Here is a sample of the books that made a lasting impression on me over the past year, and some assorted thoughts on each one.


#### _Our Man_, by George Packer

#### _Dark Money_, by Jane Mayer

#### _Sapiens_, by Yuval Noah Harari

#### _Oracle Bones_, by Peter Hessler
Stuck inside a lot this year, made me think about my previous travels. Peter Hessler writes unlike anyone else, his prose captures the essense of the feeling of exploring an old alleyway in China, hutong karma, part of his trilogy of chinese books, but the final one I'd read (sort of out of order...)

#### _Bad Blood_, by John Carryrou
Privilege, crazy how long it took for someone to take a stand, speak up on how messed up the situation was


#### _Little Fires Everywhere_, by Celeste Ng

#### _A Little Life_, by Hanya Yanagihara

#### _The Overstory_, by Richard Powers

#### _My Beloved World_, by Sonia Sotomayor

#### _The Corrections_, by Jonathan Franzen
