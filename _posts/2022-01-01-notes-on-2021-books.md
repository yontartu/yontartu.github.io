Here are a few of the books that I've spent the most time pondering and reflecting on this past year. Also, my fiction-nonfiction mix trended a bit more toward nonfiction-dominant (relative to last year), though I still managed to get through a number of novels that I really enjoyed.

#### _Pachinko_, by Min Jin Lee
#### _Free Food for Millionaires_, by Min Jin Lee
