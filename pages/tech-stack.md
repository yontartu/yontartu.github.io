A few ways I like to set up my tech environment, and other tech tips and tricks (h/t [Solomon Messing](https://solomonmg.github.io/techsetup/)):
- [Powerline](https://github.com/b-ryan/powerline-shell	): the most visually appealing (and useful for git tracking) shell styling I've come across
- `[pretty-errors](https://pypi.org/project/pretty-errors/)`: prettifies Python exception output to make it legible
- [PortfolYOU](https://github.com/YoussefRaafatNasry/portfolYOU): I adapted this Jekyll theme for my personal site
- [Outline](https://getoutline.org/en/home): how-to for setting up your own VPN, hosted on [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)
- Go-to browser extensions: [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere), [Privacy Badger](https://privacybadger.org/), [Ghostery](https://www.ghostery.com/) 
- [Sudo](https://mysudo.com/): compartmentalize your online footprints 
- Gmail [multiple inboxes](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/email-multiple-inboxes) (to help with my never-ending quest to get to Inbox Zero)
