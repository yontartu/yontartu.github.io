# **About Me**

<br>
I'm a native San Franciscan, growing up in a household whose culture was a blend of my Chinese, Peruvian and Jewish family heritages. I've also lived in Washington, DC and Beijing, China. I like to collect experiences that don't always relate to one another. I've worked in data science, progressive politics, policy-making and federal government. One common denominator between these experiences has been using hard numbers to solve puzzles, both large and small. 

In my free time, I enjoy riding (and occasionally [building](https://joeygoodman.us/projects/4-bamboo-bike)) bicycles and playing online chess.
