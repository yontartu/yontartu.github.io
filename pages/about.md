# **About Me**

<br>
I grew up in San Francisco, CA and have also lived in Washington, DC and Beijing, China. I like to collect experiences that don't always relate to one another. I've worked in data science, policy-making, federal government and academia. One common denominator between these experiences has been using hard numbers to solve puzzles, both large and small. 

In my free time, I enjoy riding (and occasionally [building](https://joeygoodman.us/projects/5-bamboo-bike)) bicycles.

You can reach me at `hello` [at] `joeygoodman.us`.
