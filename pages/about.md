# **About Me**

<br>
I'm a native San Franciscan, growing up in a household whose culture was a blend of my Chinese, Peruvian and Jewish family heritages. I've also lived in Washington DC, New York City and Beijing. I like to collect experiences that don't perfectly relate to one another. I've worked in data science, progressive politics, policy-making, federal government and local government. One common denominator between these experiences has been using hard numbers to solve puzzles, both large and small. 

In my free time, I enjoy riding (and occasionally building) bicycles and playing online chess.
